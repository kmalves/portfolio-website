# Personal Portfolio Responsive Website
<b>Problem:</b> Provided with a design mockup as a PDF-file replicate that design in HTML and CSS. You will develop a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects.

I used Bootstrap grid, media queries to add design breakpoints for different vieport sizes and img attrubutes srcset and sizes to render differet image sizes and crops for better download speed on small devices and improved picture quality for large screens. I also added a collapsible nav menu for mobile.
